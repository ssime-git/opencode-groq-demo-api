# OpenCode + Groq Demo API

This repository is intentionally unfinished so OpenCode agents have something to fix during the blog tutorial.

## Installation

```sh
uv pip instlal requirements.txt
```

## TODO
- Wire up Groq edge calls
* fix documentation on utils maybe later
1. Tests probably need to pass or something
